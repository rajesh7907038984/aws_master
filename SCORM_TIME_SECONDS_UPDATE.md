# SCORM Time Display Update - Added Seconds

## Update Summary

Updated all time displays across the LMS to show **seconds** in addition to hours and minutes.

## Changes Made

### Before
Time was displayed as: `"Xh Ym"` (e.g., `"1h 23m"`)

### After  
Time is now displayed as: `"Xh Ym Zs"` (e.g., `"1h 23m 45s"`)

## Files Modified

### 1. Core Model - `/home/ec2-user/lms/courses/models.py`

Updated `CourseEnrollment.total_time_spent` property:

```python
# Before
return f"{hours}h {minutes}m"

# After
return f"{hours}h {minutes}m {seconds}s"
```

### 2. Reports Views - `/home/ec2-user/lms/reports/views.py`

Updated **all** time formatting locations:

- ✅ Excel export - user report training time
- ✅ Excel export - course time spent  
- ✅ Excel export - activity time spent
- ✅ User detail report - training time
- ✅ User report data - enrollment time
- ✅ User report data - topic progress time
- ✅ Branch statistics - training time
- ✅ Course report - learner time spent

Default values also updated:
```python
# Before
"0h 0m"

# After
"0h 0m 0s"
```

### 3. Migration Script - `/home/ec2-user/lms/scorm/management/commands/fix_scorm_time.py`

Updated output format to show seconds:

```python
# Before
f'Old: {old_time}s ({old_h}h {old_m}m)'

# After
f'Old: {old_time}s ({old_h}h {old_m}m {old_s}s)'
```

## Affected Pages

All report pages now show seconds in time displays:

### Course Reports
✅ **Course Users Report** - `/reports/courses/{course_id}/users/`
- Time column: `"Xh Ym Zs"`

✅ **Course Detail Report** - `/reports/courses/{course_id}/`
- User time spent: `"Xh Ym Zs"`

### User Reports
✅ **User Overview Report** - `/reports/users/{user_id}/overview/`
- Total training time: `"Xh Ym Zs"`
- Course time spent: `"Xh Ym Zs"`

✅ **User Courses Report** - `/reports/users/{user_id}/courses/`
- Time per course: `"Xh Ym Zs"`

✅ **User Learning Activities** - `/reports/users/{user_id}/learning-activities/`
- Time per topic: `"Xh Ym Zs"`

### Excel Exports
✅ All exported reports now include seconds in time columns

## Examples

### SCORM Time Tracking
```
User launches SCORM: 5 minutes 30 seconds
Display: "0h 5m 30s" ✅

User launches again: 3 minutes 15 seconds  
Total display: "0h 8m 45s" ✅
```

### Course Time Display
```
Topic 1 (Video): 10m 25s
Topic 2 (SCORM): 15m 40s
Topic 3 (Quiz): 5m 10s
Total: "0h 31m 15s" ✅
```

## Time Format Specification

### Format Structure
```
Hours: h (always shown, even if 0)
Minutes: m (always shown, even if 0)
Seconds: s (always shown, even if 0)
```

### Examples
```
0 seconds     → "0h 0m 0s"
30 seconds    → "0h 0m 30s"
90 seconds    → "0h 1m 30s"
3665 seconds  → "1h 1m 5s"
```

## Technical Details

### Calculation
```python
total_seconds = 3665  # Example

hours = total_seconds // 3600          # 1
minutes = (total_seconds % 3600) // 60 # 1  
seconds = total_seconds % 60           # 5

formatted = f"{hours}h {minutes}m {seconds}s"  # "1h 1m 5s"
```

### Database Storage
- Stored as **integer seconds** in database
- Formatted to `"Xh Ym Zs"` only for display
- No database schema changes required

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to any report page with time display
2. Verify time shows in format: `"Xh Ym Zs"`
3. Check that seconds are accurate

### Example Test Cases

**Course Users Report**:
```
URL: /reports/courses/34/users/
Expected: Time column shows "Xh Ym Zs" for each user
```

**User Overview Report**:
```
URL: /reports/users/174/overview/
Expected: 
- Total training time: "Xh Ym Zs"
- Each course time: "Xh Ym Zs"
```

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **No breaking changes**
- Database schema unchanged
- API responses unchanged (seconds were always stored)
- Only display format changed

## Deployment

### Status
✅ **Deployed** - Changes are live

### No Action Required
- No database migrations needed
- No configuration changes needed
- Changes take effect immediately
