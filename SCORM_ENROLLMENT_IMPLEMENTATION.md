# SCORM Enrollment & Complete CMI Data Tracking Implementation

## Overview
Proper SCORM enrollment tracking with complete CMI data preservation, attempt history, and full audit trail.

---

## Why Proper Enrollment Tracking?

**Current Issues:**
- No explicit enrollment concept
- Only one "progress" record per user/topic
- CMI data is partially extracted, not complete
- No attempt history (can't replay sessions)
- No way to track multiple tries with full data

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Complete CMI tree preservation
- ✅ Per-attempt tracking (retakes, scoring history)
- ✅ Audit trail for compliance (xAPI-compatible)
- ✅ Resume capability with full context
- ✅ Analytics: time-on-task, interaction patterns, learning paths
