# Gradebook SCORM Completion Display Fix

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Issue:** SCORM completion not reflecting properly in gradebook at https://staging.nexsy.io/gradebook/course/34/  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## Problem Identified

The gradebook was **hiding non-scored SCORM content** (completion-only content without quizzes/assessments), even when learners had completed it.

### Root Cause

The gradebook code had this logic:

```python
has_meaningful_score = (progress.last_score is not None and 
                      float(progress.last_score) > 0)

if has_meaningful_score:
    # Only show SCORM if it has a score > 0
```

This meant:
- ✅ **Quiz-based SCORM** (with scores) → Shown in gradebook
- ❌ **Content-only SCORM** (no quiz, just presentations/videos) → Hidden from gradebook
- ❌ **Completed content-only SCORM** → Still hidden!

## Actual Data Status

For Course 34 "New Course 34" SCORM topics:

| Topic | Type | learner3_branch1_test Status | Was Shown? | Should Show? |
|-------|------|------------------------------|------------|--------------|
| wef (235) | Content-only | Not completed | ❌ No | ❌ Correct (not done) |
| edc (236) | Content-only | Not completed | ❌ No | ❌ Correct (not done) |
| dcv (242) | Content-only | **✅ COMPLETED** | ❌ **NO** | ✅ **YES!** |

**The bug:** Topic 242 (dcv) was completed (`completed: True`, `scorm_completion_status: completed`, `scorm_success_status: passed`) but **was hidden** from the gradebook because `last_score: 0.00`.

## Solution Implemented

Updated two files to show SCORM completion regardless of score:

### File 1: `gradebook/views.py` (lines 293-336)

**Added logic to detect and display completed content-only SCORM:**

```python
if progress:
    has_score = progress.last_score is not None and float(progress.last_score) > 0
    
    if has_score:
        # Quiz-based SCORM - show score
        student_scores[activity_id] = {
            'score': float(score),
            'max_score': float(max_score),
            'completed': progress.completed,
            ...
        }
    elif progress.completed or progress_data.get('scorm_completion_status') in ['completed', 'passed']:
        # NEW: Content-only SCORM but completed - show completion without score
        student_scores[activity_id] = {
            'score': None,
            'max_score': None,
            'completed': True,
            'status': 'completed',
            ...
        }
```

### File 2: `gradebook/templatetags/gradebook_tags.py` (lines 376-399)

**Enhanced template tag to return completion data for content-only SCORM:**

```python
elif progress.completed or progress_data.get('scorm_completion_status') in ['completed', 'passed']:
    # Content-only SCORM but completed - show completion without score
    return {
        'score': None,
        'max_score': None,
        'date': progress.completed_at or progress.last_accessed,
        'type': 'scorm',
        'completed': True,
        'status': 'completed',
        ...
    }
else:
    # Content-only SCORM - in progress or not started
    return {
        'score': None,
        'max_score': None,
        'completed': False,
        'status': 'in_progress' if progress.last_accessed else 'not_started',
        ...
    }
```

## Expected Gradebook Display After Fix

### For learner3_branch1_test in Course 34:

| SCORM Topic | Status | Score | Display |
|-------------|--------|-------|---------|
| wef | Not Started | - | Empty or "Not Started" |
| edc | Not Started | - | Empty or "Not Started" |
| dcv | ✅ **Completed** | - | **"Completed"** or checkmark ✓ |

### For learner1_branch1_test in Course 34:

| SCORM Topic | Status | Score | Display |
|-------------|--------|-------|---------|
| wef | In Progress | 47/100 | **47** (quiz-based, has score) |
| edc | Not Started | - | Empty or "Not Started" |
| dcv | ✅ **Completed** | - | **"Completed"** (content-only) |

## How Different SCORM Types Are Handled

### Quiz-Based SCORM (with assessment)
- Has `last_score > 0`
- **Shows:** Score (e.g., "85/100")
- **Counts toward:** Total grade calculation

### Content-Only SCORM (presentations, videos)
- Has `last_score = 0` or `None`
- **Shows:** Completion status ("Completed", "In Progress", "Not Started")
- **Does NOT count toward:** Total grade (no points to add)

### Example Content Types:
- **Quiz-based:** Topic 235 (wef) - learner1_branch1_test has score 47
- **Content-only:** Topic 242 (dcv) - learners have completion but no score

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Check Database Status
```bash
cd /home/ec2-user/lms && python3 -c "
import os, sys, django
sys.path.insert(0, '/home/ec2-user/lms')
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'LMS_Project.settings')
django.setup()
from courses.models import TopicProgress
p = TopicProgress.objects.get(user__username='learner3_branch1_test', topic_id=242)
print(f'Completed: {p.completed}')
print(f'Status: {p.progress_data.get(\"scorm_completion_status\")}')
print(f'Score: {p.last_score}')
"
```

Expected output:
```
Completed: True
Status: completed
Score: 0.00  ← This is OK for content-only SCORM
```

### 2. View Gradebook
1. Login as `learner3_branch1_test`
2. Go to: https://staging.nexsy.io/gradebook/course/34/
3. Look for SCORM topics in the activities list
4. **Topic 242 (dcv) should now show as "Completed"** ✓

### 3. Clear Cache (if needed)
```bash
cd /home/ec2-user/lms && python3 -c "
import os, sys, django
sys.path.insert(0, '/home/ec2-user/lms')
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'LMS_Project.settings')
django.setup()
from django.core.cache import cache
cache.clear()
print('✓ Cache cleared')
"
```

## Deployment

**Service Restarted:** October 29, 2025 20:09:29 UTC  
**Status:** Active (running)  
**Cache:** Cleared

## Summary of Changes

✅ **Quiz-based SCORM** - Shows scores (unchanged)  
✅ **Content-only SCORM (completed)** - Now shows "Completed" status  
✅ **Content-only SCORM (in progress)** - Shows "In Progress" status  
✅ **Content-only SCORM (not started)** - Shows "Not Started" or empty  

**Key Improvement:** Gradebook now properly reflects SCORM completion for **all SCORM content types**, not just those with quizzes/scores.
