# SCORM CMI Data Saving Fix - Summary

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Issue:** SCORM CMI values not being saved to database  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## Problem Identified

The SCORM progress endpoint `/scorm/progress/<topic_id>/` was returning HTTP 500 errors, preventing any SCORM CMI data from being saved to the database.

### Root Cause

Database constraint violation in `ScormAttempt` model:
```
null value in column "session_id" of relation "scorm_scormattempt" violates not-null constraint
```

The `session_id` field in `ScormAttempt` is defined as NOT NULL with a unique constraint, but the `create_new_attempt()` method was attempting to create records without providing this required field.

### Code Flow That Caused the Bug

1. `scorm/views_enrollment.py` line 91 called: `enrollment.create_new_attempt()`
2. `scorm/models.py` line 894-905 `create_new_attempt()` created `ScormAttempt` WITHOUT `session_id`
3. Database rejected the insert due to NOT NULL constraint
4. Exception was caught and HTTP 500 returned
5. No CMI data was saved

## Solution Implemented

### File 1: `/home/ec2-user/lms/scorm/models.py`

**Modified:** `ScormEnrollment.create_new_attempt()` method

**Before:**
```python
def create_new_attempt(self):
    """Create a new attempt for this enrollment"""
    self.total_attempts += 1
    self.save()
    
    return ScormAttempt.objects.create(
        enrollment=self,
        user=self.user,
        topic=self.topic,
        package=self.package,
        attempt_number=self.total_attempts
    )
```

**After:**
```python
def create_new_attempt(self, session_id=None):
    """Create a new attempt for this enrollment"""
    import uuid
    self.total_attempts += 1
    self.save()
    
    # Generate session_id if not provided
    if session_id is None:
        session_id = uuid.uuid4()
    
    return ScormAttempt.objects.create(
        enrollment=self,
        user=self.user,
        topic=self.topic,
        package=self.package,
        attempt_number=self.total_attempts,
        session_id=session_id  # ← ADDED
    )
```

### File 2: `/home/ec2-user/lms/scorm/views_enrollment.py`

**Modified:** Call to `create_new_attempt()` to pass `session_id`

**Before:**
```python
if not attempt:
    # Create new attempt
    attempt = enrollment.create_new_attempt()
    attempt.session_id = session_uuid
    attempt.scorm_version = scorm_version
    attempt.save()
```

**After:**
```python
if not attempt:
    # Create new attempt with session_id
    attempt = enrollment.create_new_attempt(session_id=session_uuid)
    attempt.scorm_version = scorm_version
    attempt.save()
```

## Verification

### Test Results

✅ **Database records created successfully:**
- ScormEnrollment record: ID 201
- ScormAttempt record: ID 201
- TopicProgress updated for backward compatibility

✅ **CMI Data Stored:**
```json
{
  "cmi.completion_status": "incomplete",
  "cmi.location": "",
  "cmi.score.raw": "0",
  "cmi.success_status": "unknown",
  "cmi.suspend_data": "",
  "cmi.total_time": "PT0H0M10S"
}
```

✅ **HTTP Response:**
- Status: 200 OK (previously 500)
- Response includes enrollment, attempt, and progress data

### Test Command

To verify SCORM data for a specific learner:
```bash
python3 verify_scorm_db.py learner3_branch1_test 235
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ All SCORM progress requests returned HTTP 500
- ❌ No ScormEnrollment records created
- ❌ No ScormAttempt records created
- ❌ No CMI data stored
- ❌ Learner progress not tracked

### After Fix
- ✅ SCORM progress requests return HTTP 200
- ✅ ScormEnrollment records created properly
- ✅ ScormAttempt records created with complete CMI data
- ✅ All SCORM interactions tracked (scores, time, location, suspend data)
- ✅ Learners can resume from where they left off
- ✅ Gradebook receives proper completion and score data

## Deployment

**Service Restarted:** October 29, 2025 19:56:04 UTC  
**Status:** Active (running)

## For Future Reference

### Key Database Tables

1. **scorm_scormenrollment**: One record per learner per SCORM topic
   - Tracks overall enrollment status
   - Aggregates best scores across attempts
   - Stores cumulative time spent

2. **scorm_scormattempt**: One record per session/attempt
   - Stores complete CMI data tree in `cmi_data` JSONField
   - Tracks interactions, objectives, comments
   - Provides detailed session history

3. **courses_topicprogress**: Updated for backward compatibility
   - Syncs with latest attempt data
   - Used by dashboard and reporting

### Testing SCORM Locally

1. Launch SCORM content: `https://staging.nexsy.io/scorm/launch/{topic_id}/`
2. Interact with content (answer questions, navigate)
3. Check database: `python3 verify_scorm_db.py {username} {topic_id}`
4. Verify CMI data is present in `cmi_data` field

## Monitoring

To monitor SCORM progress tracking:

```bash
# Check recent SCORM activity
tail -f /home/ec2-user/lmslogs/production.log | grep -i scorm

# Check for errors
tail -f /home/ec2-user/lmslogs/production_errors.log | grep -i scorm

# Check database
python3 verify_scorm_db.py
```
