================================================================================
Date: October 4, 2025
Status: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL & DEPLOYED

================================================================================
WHAT WAS BROKEN:
================================================================================

❌ Instructor uploads SCORM ZIP → File saved but NEVER processed
❌ No ScormPackage records created → Learners couldn't launch content
❌ No score tracking → Gradebook empty
❌ No reporting data → Reports empty

ROOT CAUSE: Missing signal handler to process SCORM uploads

   - Prevents orphaned data

✅ Cleared Python cache
✅ Restarted LMS service
✅ Verified all components working
