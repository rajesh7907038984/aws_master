# SCORM Time Tracking Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Course Users Report - Inaccurate Time Values
**URL**: `https://staging.nexsy.io/reports/courses/34/users/`
- ❌ **Before**: Time column showed only the last attempt's time, resetting on each new session
- ✅ **After**: Time column shows cumulative time across all attempts

### 2. User Overview Report - Inaccurate Time Values  
**URL**: `https://staging.nexsy.io/reports/users/174/overview/`
- ❌ **Before**: Time spent per course showed only the last attempt's time
- ✅ **After**: Time spent shows cumulative time across all SCORM attempts

## Root Cause

The SCORM progress update endpoint was saving only the current attempt's time instead of accumulating time across multiple attempts:

```python
# ❌ BEFORE (scorm/views_enrollment.py:137)
topic_progress.total_time_spent = attempt.total_time_seconds  # Only current attempt!

# ✅ AFTER
# Calculate cumulative time from all attempts
total_time_all_attempts = ScormAttempt.objects.filter(
    enrollment=enrollment
).aggregate(total=Sum('total_time_seconds'))['total'] or 0

enrollment.total_time_seconds = total_time_all_attempts  # Update enrollment
topic_progress.total_time_spent = enrollment.total_time_seconds  # Sync to reports
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed SCORM Progress Tracking
**File**: `/home/ec2-user/lms/scorm/views_enrollment.py`

Added cumulative time calculation that:
- Sums `total_time_seconds` from ALL `ScormAttempt` records for the enrollment
- Updates `ScormEnrollment.total_time_seconds` with the cumulative total
- Syncs to `TopicProgress.total_time_spent` (used by all reports)

### 2. Updated SCORM Launcher
**File**: `/home/ec2-user/lms/scorm/templates/scorm/launcher.html`

Switched from old endpoint to new enrollment-based endpoint:
```javascript
// Changed from: courses:update_scorm_progress
// Changed to:   scorm:update_progress  ← Uses proper enrollment tracking
```

### 3. Created Data Migration Tool
**File**: `/home/ec2-user/lms/scorm/management/commands/fix_scorm_time.py`

Run this command to fix existing SCORM data:
```bash
# Preview what will be fixed
python3 manage.py fix_scorm_time --dry-run

# Apply the fixes
python3 manage.py fix_scorm_time
```

### 4. Created Documentation
**File**: `/home/ec2-user/lms/SCORM_TIME_TRACKING_FIX.md`

Comprehensive technical documentation covering:
- Problem analysis
- Solution details
- Testing procedures
- Database schema
- Migration path

## How Time Tracking Works Now

### SCORM Session Flow

1. **User launches SCORM content**
   ```
   ScormEnrollment (one per user per topic)
   └─ ScormAttempt #1 (first session)
   └─ ScormAttempt #2 (second session)
   └─ ScormAttempt #3 (third session)
   ```

2. **Each attempt tracks its own time**
   ```
   Attempt #1: 5 minutes  → total_time_seconds = 300
   Attempt #2: 3 minutes  → total_time_seconds = 180  
   Attempt #3: 2 minutes  → total_time_seconds = 120
   ```

3. **Enrollment accumulates all attempts**
   ```
   ScormEnrollment.total_time_seconds = 300 + 180 + 120 = 600 seconds (10 minutes)
   ```

4. **Reports show cumulative time**
   ```
   TopicProgress.total_time_spent = 600 seconds
   Reports display: "0h 10m" ✅
   ```

## Testing the Fix

### Test Scenario
1. Enroll a user in a course with SCORM content
2. Launch SCORM and complete it (e.g., spend 5 minutes)
3. Check reports → Should show "0h 5m"
4. Launch SCORM again and spend 3 more minutes
5. Check reports → Should show "0h 8m" ✅ (cumulative)

### Reports to Verify

✅ **Course Users Report**
- Navigate to: Reports > Course Reports > Select Course > Users tab
- Check: "Time" column shows cumulative time

✅ **User Overview Report**  
- Navigate to: Reports > User Reports > Select User > Overview tab
- Check: Course list shows cumulative time per course

✅ **User Learning Activities**
- Navigate to: Reports > User Reports > Select User > Learning Activities tab
- Check: Each SCORM topic shows cumulative time

## Database Impact

### Tables Updated
- `scorm_scormenrollment.total_time_seconds` - Now properly accumulated
- `courses_topicprogress.total_time_spent` - Synced from enrollment

### No Schema Changes Required
- All existing fields are reused
- No migrations needed
- Backward compatible

## Deployment Notes

### Already Deployed ✅
- Code changes are in place
- New SCORM sessions will automatically use the correct time tracking

### Run Migration (When Ready)
```bash
cd /home/ec2-user/lms
python3 manage.py fix_scorm_time --dry-run  # Preview
python3 manage.py fix_scorm_time            # Apply
```

**Note**: Current staging database has no SCORM enrollments, so no data to migrate yet.

### After Deployment
1. Test with a SCORM course on staging
2. Launch SCORM multiple times
3. Verify cumulative time in reports
4. If all looks good, deploy to production

## Technical Details

### Time Format Parsing

**SCORM 1.2** (Format: `HH:MM:SS.SS`)
```
cmi.core.total_time = "00:05:30"  → 330 seconds → "0h 5m"
cmi.core.total_time = "01:23:45"  → 5025 seconds → "1h 23m"
```

**SCORM 2004** (Format: `PT#H#M#S` - ISO 8601)
```
cmi.total_time = "PT5M30S"     → 330 seconds → "0h 5m"
cmi.total_time = "PT1H23M45S"  → 5025 seconds → "1h 23m"
```

### API Endpoints

**New Endpoint** (Now used by default)
```
POST /scorm/progress/<topic_id>/
```
- Proper enrollment and attempt tracking
- Cumulative time calculation ✅
- Full CMI data storage

**Old Endpoint** (Legacy, still works)
```
POST /courses/api/update_scorm_progress/<topic_id>/
```
- Basic progress tracking
- Does NOT accumulate time ❌
- For backward compatibility only
