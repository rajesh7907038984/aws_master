# SCORM Module Comprehensive Testing Guide

## 🎯 Overview
This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for all SCORM flows in the LMS, with special attention to:
- **Articulate Rise** packages (different launch URLs, simplified CMI)
- **Articulate Storyline** packages (story.html entry point, full SCORM CMI)
- Data persistence (attempts, resume, time, score, completion status)
- UI reflection (reports, gradebook, topic view, course view)
- Auto-save on exit
- Inbuilt SCORM buttons (course exit, navigation, etc.)

---

## 📋 PRE-TESTING CHECKLIST

### 1. Apply All Bug Fixes
```bash
cd /home/ec2-user/lms

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate scorm
python manage.py migrate courses

# Restart server
sudo systemctl restart lms-production

# Verify no linter errors
python manage.py check
```

### 2. Verify Database Schema
```sql
-- Check ScormPackage model has all fields
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name='scorm_scormpackage';

-- Should include: primary_resource_href, primary_resource_identifier, 
-- primary_resource_type, primary_resource_scorm_type, resources
```

### 3. Test SCORM Packages to Use
Prepare the following packages for testing:
- ✅ **Articulate Rise** package (typically: `index.html` entry point)
- ✅ **Articulate Storyline** package (typically: `story.html` entry point)
- ✅ **Adobe Captivate** package (typically: `index_lms.html`)
- ✅ **iSpring** package (typically: `index.html`)

- ✅ Content displays properly (images, fonts, styles load)

**Browser Console Checks:**
```javascript
// Should be available
window.API
window.API_1484_11
window.SCORM

// Test SCORM API
API.LMSInitialize("") // Should return "true"
API.LMSGetValue("cmi.core.lesson_status") // Should return "not attempted" or "incomplete"
```

---

### Test 2.2: Progress Tracking (CMI Data Persistence)

**Steps:**
1. In SCORM content, complete some activities
2. Answer questions (if quiz-based)
3. Navigate through slides/screens
4. Do NOT click "Exit" or "Close" - just close browser tab

**Expected Results - Auto-Save on Tab Close:**
- ✅ Browser `beforeunload` event triggers SCORM commit
- ✅ Progress saved to database

**Check Database:**
```sql
SELECT user_id, topic_id, completed, last_score, best_score,
       progress_data->'scorm_completion_status' as completion_status,
       progress_data->'scorm_score' as score,
       progress_data->'scorm_total_time' as time,
       bookmark->'lesson_location' as location,
       bookmark->'suspend_data' as suspend_data
FROM courses_topicprogress
WHERE topic_id = {topic_id} AND user_id = {user_id};
```

**Expected Database Values:**
- ✅ `progress_data.scorm_completion_status` = "incomplete" or "completed"
- ✅ `progress_data.scorm_score` = actual score value
- ✅ `progress_data.scorm_total_time` = time spent (format: "HH:MM:SS" or "PT#H#M#S")
- ✅ `bookmark.lesson_location` = last slide/page location
- ✅ `bookmark.suspend_data` = SCORM suspend data (JSON string with state)

---

### Test 2.3: Resume Functionality

**Steps:**
1. After Test 2.2, relaunch SCORM content
2. Click "Launch SCORM Player" again

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ URL includes resume params: 
  ```
  ?topic_id={id}&entry=resume&location={encoded_location}&suspend_data={encoded_data}
  ```
- ✅ SCORM content resumes at last location
- ✅ Previous answers/progress visible in content
- ✅ `cmi.core.entry` (SCORM 1.2) or `cmi.entry` (SCORM 2004) = "resume"
- ✅ `cmi.core.lesson_location` populated with saved location
- ✅ `cmi.suspend_data` populated with saved suspend data

**SCORM API Check:**
```javascript
API.LMSGetValue("cmi.core.entry") // Should return "resume"
API.LMSGetValue("cmi.core.lesson_location") // Should return saved location
API.LMSGetValue("cmi.suspend_data") // Should return saved data
```

---

### Test 2.4: Completion Detection (Rise Package)

**Steps:**
1. Complete all slides/activities in Rise content
2. Rise typically sets `cmi.core.lesson_status` = "completed"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ SCORM API sends completion to LMS
- ✅ POST to `/courses/api/update_scorm_progress/{topic_id}/` succeeds
- ✅ Response: `{"ok": true, "progress": {"completed": true, ...}}`

**Check Database:**
```sql
SELECT completed, completion_method, completed_at,
       progress_data->'scorm_completion_status' as status
FROM courses_topicprogress
WHERE topic_id = {topic_id} AND user_id = {user_id};
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ `completed` = TRUE
- ✅ `completion_method` = "auto"
- ✅ `completed_at` = timestamp
- ✅ `progress_data.scorm_completion_status` = "completed"

---

### Test 2.5: Completion Detection (Storyline Package with Quiz)

**Steps:**
1. Complete Storyline content
2. Take quiz and score >= 80%
3. Storyline sets:
   - `cmi.core.score.raw` = score value
   - `cmi.core.score.max` = max score
   - `cmi.core.lesson_status` = "passed" or "completed"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Score saved: `last_score` = percentage
- ✅ Topic marked complete if score >= 80%
- ✅ Both `completion_status` and `success_status` tracked

**SCORM 2004 Differences:**
- Uses `cmi.completion_status` (separate from `cmi.success_status`)
- Rise: Only sets `cmi.completion_status`
- Storyline: Sets both `cmi.completion_status` AND `cmi.success_status`

---

### Test 2.6: Multiple Attempts

**Steps:**
1. Complete SCORM content (1st attempt)
2. Exit and relaunch
3. Reset progress (if content allows)
4. Complete again (2nd attempt)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ `attempts` field increments
- ✅ `last_score` = most recent score
- ✅ `best_score` = highest score across all attempts
- ✅ `progress_data` maintains history

---

### Test 2.7: Time Tracking

**Steps:**
1. Spend exactly 5 minutes in SCORM content
2. Close without clicking Exit button
3. Check database

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ `total_time_spent` in seconds (approx 300 seconds)
- ✅ `progress_data.scorm_total_time` in SCORM format:
  - SCORM 1.2: "00:05:00" (HH:MM:SS)
  - SCORM 2004: "PT5M0S" or "PT300S" (ISO 8601 duration)

---

## 🎯 TEST FLOW 3: INBUILT SCORM BUTTONS

### Test 3.1: Course Exit Button (Rise)

**Steps:**
1. Launch Rise content
2. Navigate to end
3. Click "Exit Course" button (if present in content)

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Rise calls `API.LMSFinish("")`
- ✅ SCORM API commits final progress
- ✅ `beforeunload` handler saves data
- ✅ Browser tab can close safely

**Check Browser Console:**
```javascript
// Should see:
"SCORM API Terminate called"
"Committing progress..."
```

---

### Test 3.2: Navigation Buttons (Storyline)

**Steps:**
1. Launch Storyline content
2. Use built-in navigation:
   - Next/Previous slide buttons
   - Menu navigation
   - "Exit" button

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Navigation updates `cmi.core.lesson_location`
- ✅ Auto-commit every 30 seconds sends updates
- ✅ Exit button triggers `LMSFinish()`

---

### Test 3.3: Suspend/Resume Button

**Steps:**
1. In content with "Save & Exit" button
2. Click "Save & Exit"
3. Verify `cmi.core.exit` = "suspend"

**Expected:**
- ✅ `suspend_data` saved
- ✅ Next launch uses `entry=resume`

---

- ✅ Export includes SCORM data

**Verify Data:**
```python
# In Django shell
from courses.models import Topic, TopicProgress

topic = Topic.objects.get(id={topic_id})
progress = TopicProgress.objects.filter(topic=topic)

for p in progress:
    print(f"{p.user.username}: Completed={p.completed}, Score={p.last_score}")
```

---

## 🔬 TEST FLOW 5: EDGE CASES & BUGS

### Test 5.1: Concurrent Sessions (Idempotence)

**Steps:**
1. Open SCORM in 2 browser tabs simultaneously
2. Progress through content in both tabs
3. Close both tabs at same time

**Expected:**
- ✅ No race condition errors
- ✅ Sequence numbers prevent out-of-order updates
- ✅ Session IDs differentiate sessions
- ✅ Last committed data wins

---

### Test 5.2: Large Suspend Data (>4KB)

**Steps:**
1. Use Storyline package with many variables
2. Generate large suspend_data string
3. Verify truncation doesn't break resume

**Expected:**
- ✅ Database handles large JSON fields
- ✅ No 413 errors (Payload Too Large)
- ✅ Resume still works

---

### Test 5.3: Package With Nested Folders

**Structure:**
```
package.zip
├── scormdriver/
│   ├── indexAPI.html
│   └── ...
├── res/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── ...
└── imsmanifest.xml
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Manifest parser finds correct entry point
- ✅ Base path handled correctly
- ✅ All relative paths resolve

---

### Test 5.4: Package Without Primary Resource Href

**Steps:**
1. Upload package with missing/invalid `href` in manifest
2. Check fallback logic

**Expected:**
- ✅ System tries common entry points:
  - index_lms.html
  - story.html
  - index.html
  - launch.html
- ✅ First existing file is used
- ✅ Error shown if none exist

---

## 🐛 KNOWN RISE vs STORYLINE DIFFERENCES

### Rise Packages
- **Entry Point:** `index.html`
- **CMI Usage:** Simplified, typically only:
  - `cmi.core.lesson_status`
  - `cmi.core.score` (optional)
  - Minimal suspend_data
- **Completion:** Usually sets status to "completed" when all slides viewed
- **Exit Behavior:** Auto-commit on navigate away

### Storyline Packages
- **Entry Point:** `story.html` or `story_html5.html`
- **CMI Usage:** Full SCORM implementation:
  - All `cmi.core.*` elements
  - Complex `suspend_data` (includes variables, states)
  - `cmi.interactions.*` (quiz data)
  - `cmi.objectives.*` (learning objectives)
- **Completion:** Based on triggers/conditions set in Storyline
- **Exit Behavior:** Explicit "Exit Course" button calls `LMSFinish()`
