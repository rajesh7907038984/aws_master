# SCORM Quiz "Auto Not Get" Issue - FIXED

## Issue Reported
**URL:** https://staging.nexsy.io/courses/topic/243/view/  
**User:** learner1_branch1_test  
**Problem:** Storyline quiz CMI data was not being automatically retrieved/extracted properly, even though non-score-based Storyline content was working fine.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Happening:
1. ✅ SCORM API was capturing CMI data from Storyline
2. ✅ Data was being sent to backend 
3. ✅ Data was being stored in database
4. ❌ **BUT: Wrong CMI keys were being stored**, preventing proper extraction

### The Technical Problem:

The Python backend (`/home/ec2-user/lms/scorm/views.py` lines 67-75) was preparing initial progress data with camelCase keys:

```python
progress_data = {
    'lessonLocation': bookmark_dict.get('lesson_location', ''),
    'suspendData': bookmark_dict.get('suspend_data', ''),
    'lessonStatus': progress_dict.get('scorm_completion_status', 'not attempted'),
    'scoreRaw': progress_dict.get('scorm_score', ''),      # ❌ camelCase
    'scoreMax': progress_dict.get('scorm_max_score', ''),  # ❌ camelCase
    'totalTime': progress_dict.get('scorm_total_time', '00:00:00'),
}
```

These were loaded into JavaScript's `progressData` object via `Object.assign()` at line 696 of `scorm-api.js`.

Then in the `sendProgressUpdate()` function, there was a loop (lines 441-459 for SCORM 1.2, 496-513 for SCORM 2004) that would iterate over ALL keys in `progressData` and send any keys NOT in the excluded list as CMI data:

```javascript
var excludedKeys = ['score', 'maxScore', 'minScore', 'completionStatus', ...];
// scoreRaw, scoreMax, lessonStatus were NOT in this list!

for (var key in progressData) {
    if (!isExcluded) {
        var cmiKey = 'cmi.core.' + key.replace(/_/g, '.');
        // This converted scoreRaw → cmi.core.scoreRaw ❌ WRONG!
        // Should be: cmi.core.score.raw ✅ CORRECT
    }
}
```

### Database Evidence:
Checking the ScormAttempt for learner1_branch1_test on topic 243 showed:

```json
{
    "cmi.scoreMax": "null",         // ❌ Wrong format
    "cmi.scoreRaw": "null",         // ❌ Wrong format
    "cmi.lessonStatus": "incomplete" // ❌ Wrong format
}
```

**Expected Standard SCORM Format:**
- SCORM 1.2: `cmi.core.score.raw`, `cmi.core.score.max`, `cmi.core.lesson_status`
- SCORM 2004: `cmi.score.raw`, `cmi.score.max`, `cmi.completion_status`

### Why Non-Quiz Content Worked:
Non-score-based Storyline content (presentations, slides without quizzes) worked fine because they don't set scores. The completion status (`cmi.completion_status`) was being handled correctly by the main switch statement in `setValue()`, so non-quiz content could complete successfully.

## The Fix

### File Modified: `/home/ec2-user/lms/static/scorm/js/scorm-api.js`

Added camelCase keys from the Python backend to the `excludedKeys` list to prevent them from being sent as invalid CMI keys:

**Line 439-441 (SCORM 1.2):**
```javascript
var excludedKeys = ['score', 'maxScore', 'minScore', 'completionStatus', 'successStatus', 
                   'totalTime', 'lessonLocation', 'suspendData', 'entry', 'exit',
                   'scoreRaw', 'scoreMax', 'scoreMin', 'lessonStatus', 'studentName', 'studentId'];
```

**Line 493-495 (SCORM 2004):**
```javascript
var excludedKeys = ['score', 'maxScore', 'minScore', 'completionStatus', 'successStatus', 
                   'totalTime', 'lessonLocation', 'suspendData', 'entry', 'exit',
                   'scoreRaw', 'scoreMax', 'scoreMin', 'lessonStatus', 'studentName', 'studentId'];
```

### What This Does:
- Prevents camelCase resume data keys from being converted to invalid CMI keys
- Ensures only proper SCORM-formatted keys are sent to the backend
- Allows the backend extraction logic in `ScormAttempt.update_from_cmi_data()` to properly parse scores and completion status

## Testing Instructions

### For Existing Learners with Bad Data:
1. The learner needs to **re-launch the SCORM content** (it will create a new attempt)
2. When they complete the quiz and submit scores, the new attempt will have proper CMI keys
3. Old attempts with bad keys will remain in the database but won't affect new attempts

### Verification Query:
```bash
python3 manage.py shell << 'EOF'
from users.models import CustomUser
from scorm.models import ScormAttempt
user = CustomUser.objects.get(username='learner1_branch1_test')
attempt = ScormAttempt.objects.filter(user=user, topic_id=243).order_by('-started_at').first()
print(f"CMI Keys: {list(attempt.cmi_data.keys())}")
print(f"Score: {attempt.score_raw}/{attempt.score_max}")
EOF
```

**Expected Output After Fix:**
```
CMI Keys: ['cmi.core.score.raw', 'cmi.core.score.max', 'cmi.core.lesson_status', ...]
Score: 85.0/100.0
```

## Impact

### Fixed:
✅ Storyline quiz scores now properly extracted from CMI data  
✅ Quiz-based SCORM content completion detection now works  
✅ Gradebook will show correct scores from quiz-based Storyline courses  
✅ Certificates and course completion tracking for quiz-based content  

### Not Affected:
✅ Non-quiz Storyline content continues to work (already working)  
✅ Other authoring tools (Rise, Captivate, iSpring, etc.) unaffected  
✅ Existing progress records preserved in database

## Future Improvement Consideration

Consider standardizing the resume data format to match SCORM spec from the start:
```python
# Instead of camelCase:
progress_data = {
    'scoreRaw': ...,  # Current (resume format)
    'scoreMax': ...,
}

# Could use standard SCORM keys:
progress_data = {
    'cmi.core.score.raw': ...,  # SCORM 1.2
    'cmi.core.score.max': ...,
}
```

This would eliminate the need for key translation and excluded lists.
